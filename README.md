User Stories:
*`As a user, I want to be able to see a question on a page`.
*I then expect to see four choices beneath the question to choose my 
answer from.
*I want to see a counter on the screen which will count how many
many questions they have got right and wrong.
*I also want to see what's the right answer if I have got it wrong.
*I like to see a final result at the end of the game of how many
questions I have scored right and how many questions I have got wrong.
